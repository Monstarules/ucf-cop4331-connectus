	<p>Kevin, mainly what the FrontEnd is about is making a good and friendly UI. It should be clean, easy on the eyes, and we should have a consistent color scheme. Keep in mind, the "index" page is typically what the user is going to be seeing when they first access the webpage properly.</p>
	<p style="color:red"><b>In this case, they should not be seeing this page immediately.</b></p>
	<p>Why? Because the index should be locked behind our login page. Either that, or we can make another index page <span style="color:blue">(remember, we want to let the user be able to make themselves an account!)</span><br>You may notice by looking at the source code of the page, there are a few different HTML code bits I have done. You may want to look at it for future reference!</p>
